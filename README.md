# Employee Turnover Prediction

This repository contains a predictive analysis project for employee turnover, aiming to help organizations reduce employee attrition by identifying key factors that lead to turnover. The analysis is performed using machine learning techniques, and the project provides insights into the most critical factors influencing employees' decisions to leave.

## Project Overview

Employee turnover is a critical challenge for businesses, often leading to increased costs and decreased productivity. This project uses Python to build a machine learning model capable of predicting employee attrition based on various features such as satisfaction level, work environment, and salary.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and processed employee data for machine learning, ensuring the dataset is ready for training and testing.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized trends and relationships between different employee attributes and their turnover rates.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Built predictive models using algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
- **Feature Importance:** Highlighted key factors such as job satisfaction, salary, and workload that significantly impact employee turnover.
- **Prediction:** The final model predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company, helping HR teams make informed decisions.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:**
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - XGBoost (optional)
  
## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-turnover-prediction.git
   cd employee-turnover-prediction
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook or script**  
   You can explore the analysis and results by running the provided Jupyter notebook or executing the Python scripts.

## Results

The trained model achieved an accuracy of `X%` on the test set, identifying critical factors that lead to employee turnover. The results suggest that by improving work conditions and offering competitive salaries, companies can significantly reduce their attrition rates.

## Future Work

Potential enhancements include fine-tuning the model further, integrating real-time data, and expanding the dataset to include different industries.
